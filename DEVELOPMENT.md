                            - Replace `profiles/username/profile.jpg` → `profiles/id/profile.jpg` so the photo stayed constant with the profile username update. ✅

        - Landing page
            - Display helpful articles perhaps describing benefits of journaling, mindful quotes/bible verses, etc.
                - Idea 💡: Have categories, and each category shows a new page of those specific quotes/articles
        - Explore page
            - A page where a users friends public journals are displayed
                - Currently displays all users, need to replace to show blogs of the logged in users friends, need to add logic to display blogs of the `loggedInUser` and blogs of those a user is friends with
        - Add API and UI for friends feature
            - If someone visits another users profile, the profile should display
                - Photo/Username ✅
                - Bio ✅
                - Public posts ✅
                - Button to Add Friend ✅
                    - Clicking this button should trigger an event that sends a POST request to an API `/api/add-user` that sends a request from the loggedInUser to the target user ✅
                    - Should populate a a field in the target user’s record `friendRequests`  with their username ex: `friendRequests: ['johndoe']`.  ✅
                    - In the settings section, there can be an option “Friends Requests” where a user can view their requests and Accept or Deny.
                        - Accept - will populate a field on the target users table `friends`  with the name of the user that sent the request, and vice versa, then send back a success response  ✅
                        - Deny - will reject it, remove username from `friendRequests` and send back a json message indicating the response ✅
                            - Clicking on either button should trigger a database POST to either
                                - Move `username` from `friendRequests` field to `friends` field (accept) ✅
                                - Remove `username` from `friendRequests` field (deny) ✅
                            - Once the request completes:
                                - If the user accepts the request, remove `username` from `friendRequests` array in state and move the `username` to `friends` array in state
                                - Otherwise, remove `username` from `friendRequests` array in state
                    - Once a pair of users are friends, the blogs field and amount of friends is visible except for the blogs that the user sets to private.
                - Friends
                    - Amount of friends
                        - When a user clicks on `friends` there should be a component that displays the list of friends a user has, similar to how `friendRequests` are stored
